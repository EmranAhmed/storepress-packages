# Introduction

## Welcome!

StorePress Packages uses Storybook to view and work with the UI components developed in WordPress packages, especially [@wordpress/components](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/components).

On this interactive site you can browse individual components, their controls, options, and settings in isolation. You can also modify controls and arguments and see the changes right away.

The components displayed on this site can be used in your code to build the editor's UI for your custom blocks or other pages.
Import them from the components root directory like in below example:

```jsx
import { Icon } from '@wordpress/icons';
import { storepress } from '@storepress/icons';

export default function StorePressIcon() {
	return <Icon icon={storepress} />
}
```
